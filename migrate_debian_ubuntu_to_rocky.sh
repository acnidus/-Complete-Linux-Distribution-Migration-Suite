# Debian/Ubuntu to Rocky Linux Migration Script
# =============================================================================
# 
# This script migrates a system from Debian/Ubuntu to Rocky Linux
# 
# IMPORTANT: 
# - ALWAYS backup your system before running this script
# - Test this migration in a non-production environment first
# - Ensure you have a recovery plan and rollback strategy
# - This script requires root privileges
# - This is a MAJOR migration between different package systems (deb to rpm)
# - Some applications may need to be reinstalled
#
# Author: System Administrator
# Version: 1.0
# Last Updated: 2024
